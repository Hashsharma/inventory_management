# Inventory Management System

## Background
The Inventory Management System is designed to help businesses efficiently manage their stock of products. This system provides RESTful API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) items in the inventory. To enhance performance, frequently accessed items are cached using Redis, and JWT authentication secures access to the API.
